            <p>
              We are the presidency of the kingdom on earth.  We are a Church/congregation that believes in the full volume of the Word of Yah, The Torah Or, Ruach Haquesh, (Yah) Love, Yeshua, and the Beauty and Truth of all creatures all intertwined in the Tree of Life as partakers of the Divine Nature of Yah. We value life and all creatures. We believe Yah has been our dwelling place in all ages for all eternity.  We Preach the gospel to all creatures.  The gospel is his commands, laws, statutes, promises, rewards, and judgement.  We Believe that Yahuah (The Most High- Yah- Creator of all things) sent his son Yeshua (our Salvation) to his people to Save, redeem, reconcile us back to the father, and restore creation back to the adamic Line and those who will believe and surrender to his Yah’s Salvation Plan.   This congregation is one that is interested in executing the Heart and Mind of Yah in raising up sons through the process of sonship like that of Enoch or Shem.  We believe that Yahuah has made this house the extension of the house of Eber/Shem.  The house of Eber/ Shem was the faithful house that kept the commandments, laws, statues, precepts and believed in Yah judgements when others didn’t in the time of the Tower of Babel.  Due to the faith this house operated in there where able to maintain the language and ancient knowledge.  We believe in the government of the Kingdom and Yahs righteousness in which we must operate as we stand steadfast in Love in Yah with dual citizenship in the earth and the heavenlies. Josephs and Asenath purpose were to join Israel and Judah.  Yah established this house initially as Ruach Reformation established from the works of Joseph and Asenath at the first 1st we observed in Woodbridge Virginia. We Represent this regathering and union of the 12 tribes.  Our Father has promised to always have a king on the throne of David until Shiloh and to restore and repair the tabernacle of David.  We believe the Creator has delegated us to sit on this throne and given us access to keys to this house as direct heir to the Davidic line and legacy recipients to his promise and the evidence of this recreation covenant of the ancient tabernacle of David restored.  This work will internationally ignite extension his glory, power, and presence locally and throughout the earth in great numbers for Yah Glory.   The gospel will be preached to all creatures 

by other nations}through higher level education and faithfulness in Yah, though legal representation and advocacy, mentorship in the reclamation of land, governments, stolen property, right standing for criminal deeds, true identity and economic liberty through establishing systems of wealth by activation and use of the keys of David in righteousness that will open up opportunity by cosmic trade, business, Real estate, national and international trade goods, partnership and gold, metal and precious stone commerce that will afford the diaspora to be true competitors and his people shall be healed, saved, and reconciled back as son according to his redemption plan with the preparation of his bride.
